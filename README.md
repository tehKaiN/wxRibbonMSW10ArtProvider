# wxRibbonMSW10ArtProvider
Class based on wxRibbonMSWArtProvider which will give your wxRibbon more recent Windows look & feel.

Code is not yet complete, but basic stuff works. Also, colors are defined in a bit hackish way - not so elegant as in original art provider. All contributions are welcome!
